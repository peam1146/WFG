# Feature Specification: shadcn/ui Migration and Component Replacement

**Feature Branch**: `003-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to migrate my app to use shadcn/ui and change all primitive components to use shadcn"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Migration request: Replace primitive components with shadcn/ui
   ‚Üí Scope: All existing UI components in the application
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers, end users
   ‚Üí Actions: migrate, replace, integrate
   ‚Üí Data: existing component library, shadcn/ui components
   ‚Üí Constraints: maintain existing functionality
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which specific components need migration priority?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should existing styling be preserved or updated to shadcn/ui defaults?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Developer workflow improvements
   ‚Üí End user experience consistency
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the WFG application, I want to migrate all primitive UI components to use shadcn/ui so that the application has a consistent, accessible, and maintainable component library that improves both developer experience and user interface quality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application currently uses custom primitive components, **When** the migration to shadcn/ui is completed, **Then** all UI components use the shadcn/ui library while maintaining existing functionality
2. **Given** shadcn/ui components are integrated, **When** developers need to create new UI elements, **Then** they can use pre-built, accessible components from the shadcn/ui library
3. **Given** the migration is complete, **When** users interact with the application, **Then** they experience improved visual consistency and accessibility features
4. **Given** shadcn/ui components are in use, **When** the application is tested, **Then** all existing functionality works without regression

### Edge Cases
- What happens when shadcn/ui components don't have direct equivalents for existing custom components?
- How does the system handle existing component props that don't map to shadcn/ui component APIs?
- What happens if shadcn/ui components conflict with existing Tailwind CSS customizations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST replace all primitive UI components with shadcn/ui equivalents
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain all existing component functionality after migration
- **FR-003**: Developers MUST be able to use shadcn/ui components for future development
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve existing accessibility features and improve them where possible
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain current application performance after component migration
- **FR-006**: System MUST migrate all components simultaneously for comprehensive shadcn/ui integration
- **FR-007**: System MUST update all existing component styling to match shadcn/ui design system
- **FR-008**: System MUST recreate custom component variants using shadcn/ui patterns and customization

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **UI Component**: Represents individual interface elements that need migration from custom implementations to shadcn/ui equivalents
- **Component Library**: Represents the collection of shadcn/ui components that will replace existing primitive components
- **Migration Mapping**: Represents the relationship between existing components and their shadcn/ui replacements
