# Feature Specification: Git Log Viewer with Daily Summaries

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-web-site`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "create web site that user cloud in put git author name and since date then ui will show all git logs that fetch from remote. Show the summary of that day in the UI. The application should save the summaries in the database but user able to click refresh to generate new summaries."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature involves Git log filtering, display, and database-stored summaries
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users (developers/project managers)
   ‚Üí Actions: Input author name, select date, view logs, view summaries, refresh summaries
   ‚Üí Data: Git commits, author names, dates, commit messages, daily summaries
   ‚Üí Constraints: Remote repository access, database storage, summary generation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Git credentials will be configured at backend level via environment variables/config files
   ‚Üí Daily summaries should be formatted as bullet points with commit messages, similar to: "18 ‡∏™.‡∏Ñ. 2568\n- Implement high-contrast mode and palette\n- Adjust color shades\n- Update tokens"
   ‚Üí System will focus on single configured repository only
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: input ‚Üí filter ‚Üí display ‚Üí view summaries ‚Üí refresh
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Git Repository, Commit, Author, Daily Summary
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding authentication and summarization"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a project manager or developer, I want to view Git commit history for a specific author within a date range, so that I can track work progress and understand daily activities. I need to see daily summaries displayed in the UI that are stored in the database, with the ability to refresh and regenerate these summaries when needed.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the Git log viewer page, **When** I enter an author name "john.doe" and select "since 2025-09-01", **Then** the system displays all commits by that author from the specified date onwards with daily summaries
2. **Given** I have filtered Git logs displayed with existing summaries, **When** I view the results, **Then** the system shows daily summaries loaded from the database
3. **Given** I have filtered Git logs displayed, **When** I click the "Refresh Summaries" button, **Then** the system regenerates daily summaries and updates the database
4. **Given** multiple commits exist on the same day, **When** I view the results, **Then** the system displays a single summary per date combining all commits for that day
5. **Given** I enter an invalid author name, **When** I submit the filter, **Then** the system displays an appropriate message indicating no commits found
6. **Given** I select a future date, **When** I apply the filter, **Then** the system handles this gracefully and shows no results

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the remote repository is unreachable or requires authentication? ‚Üí Display error message to user
- How does the system handle authors with no commits in the specified date range? ‚Üí Display "No commits found" message
- What occurs when there are thousands of commits to display (performance considerations)? ‚Üí Limit display to previous 31 days only
- How are merge commits and commit messages with special characters handled in summary generation? ‚Üí Skip merge commits, include only regular commits
- What happens when the database is unavailable or summary storage fails? ‚Üí Display error message to user
- How should the system handle concurrent refresh operations from multiple users? ‚Üí Display error message if conflict occurs

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to input a Git author name via text field
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to select a "since date" using a date picker or input field
- **FR-003**: System MUST fetch and display Git logs from remote repository based on author and date filters
- **FR-004**: System MUST display commit information including date, author, and commit message
- **FR-005**: System MUST display daily summaries in the UI for each date with commits
- **FR-006**: System MUST store generated daily summaries in a database for persistence
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a "Refresh Summaries" button to regenerate summaries
- **FR-008**: System MUST summarize multiple commits from the same day into a single description entry
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle empty result sets gracefully with appropriate user feedback
- **FR-010**: System MUST load existing summaries from database when available
- **FR-011**: System MUST update database when summaries are refreshed or regenerated
- **FR-012**: System MUST use Git credentials configured at backend level via environment variables or configuration files (resolved)
- **FR-013**: System MUST use bullet point format for daily commit summarization (resolved)
- **FR-014**: System MUST focus on single configured repository only (resolved)
- **FR-015**: System MUST limit Git log display to previous 31 days maximum for performance
- **FR-016**: System MUST skip merge commits when generating daily summaries
- **FR-017**: System MUST format daily summaries as bullet points with date header (e.g., "18 ‡∏™.‡∏Ñ. 2568\n- Task description\n- Another task")
- **FR-018**: System MUST display error messages when repository is unreachable or authentication fails
- **FR-019**: System MUST display error messages when database operations fail
- **FR-020**: System MUST display "No commits found" message when author has no commits in date range
- **FR-021**: System MUST use database schema with fields: id (primary key), author_name (string), summary_date (date), summary_text (text), repository_url (string), created_at (timestamp), updated_at (timestamp) (resolved)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Git Repository**: Represents the remote Git repository containing commit history, requires connection details and authentication
- **Commit**: Individual Git commit with timestamp, author, message, and hash identifier
- **Author**: Git commit author identified by name/email, used for filtering commits
- **Daily Summary**: Aggregated view of commits grouped by date with summarized descriptions, stored in database for persistence and UI display
- **Database Record**: Persistent storage entity containing summary data with metadata like author, date, repository, and generated summary text
- **Filter Criteria**: User-defined parameters including author name and since date for querying commits
