# Feature Specification: AI-Enhanced Worklog Summarization

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to use vercel ai sdk with openrouter on summarize worklog"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extracted: AI-powered worklog summarization using Vercel AI SDK + OpenRouter
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: users viewing worklog summaries
   ‚Üí Actions: generate intelligent summaries from Git commits
   ‚Üí Data: Git commits, AI-generated summaries
   ‚Üí Constraints: API costs, response time, summary quality
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí RESOLVED: AI models configurable via environment variables
   ‚Üí RESOLVED: Enhanced summaries provide contextual narratives vs basic concatenation
   ‚Üí RESOLVED: No user customization - predefined style and format
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: User requests worklog summary ‚Üí AI generates enhanced summary
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focuses on AI integration capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí AI Summary, Model Configuration, API Usage
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: All clarifications resolved
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the WFG Git Log Viewer, I want AI-powered worklog summaries that provide more intelligent, contextual, and readable summaries of my daily Git activity, so that I can better understand and communicate my work progress without manually interpreting raw commit messages.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have Git commits for a specific date range, **When** I request a worklog summary, **Then** the system generates an AI-enhanced summary that contextualizes commit messages into coherent work narratives
2. **Given** I have commits with technical jargon and abbreviated messages, **When** the AI processes them, **Then** it produces human-readable summaries that explain the work in business terms
3. **Given** I have multiple related commits across different files, **When** generating a summary, **Then** the AI groups related changes and explains the overall feature or fix being implemented
4. **Given** the AI service is unavailable, **When** I request a summary, **Then** the system falls back to the current basic summarization method

### Edge Cases
- What happens when API rate limits are exceeded?
- How does the system handle very large commit volumes that exceed token limits?
- What occurs when commit messages are in non-English languages?
- How are merge commits and automated commits handled differently?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate AI-enhanced summaries that provide more context and readability than basic commit concatenation
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing worklog functionality when AI services are unavailable
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to access AI-generated summaries through the existing worklog interface without workflow disruption
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle API failures gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to users
- **FR-005**: System MUST respect API rate limits and implement appropriate throttling mechanisms
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve user privacy by not storing sensitive commit content on external AI services longer than necessary
- **FR-007**: AI summaries MUST maintain accuracy to the original commit content and not introduce false information
- **FR-008**: System MUST support configurable AI model selection through environment variables for OpenRouter integration
- **FR-009**: System MUST generate AI summaries using predefined style and format without user customization options
- **FR-010**: System MUST cache AI summaries until user explicitly requests refresh through the existing refresh functionality

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **AI Summary**: Enhanced worklog summary generated by AI, containing contextual narrative of Git activity, associated with specific date range and author
- **Model Configuration**: Settings for AI model selection, prompt templates, and response parameters
- **API Usage Tracking**: Monitoring of API calls, costs, and rate limit status for operational visibility
